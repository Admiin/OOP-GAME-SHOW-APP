 OOP GAME SHOW APP

Phrase hunter - a geme where the player guess a phrase by clicking letters to hopefully fill in the blanks just enough to guess the phrase. However each wrong guess reduces the player's heart points by one. 

planning the game:
- needs to have a phrase randomizer
- needs to be able to store guesses, which includes labelling a singular guess as correct or incorrect
- needs to have a check for winning the game, as well as running out of hearts
- needs to have a way for the player to start over when the game is either one or lost
- when a player clicks a letter, the game needs to cycle through all the letters of the phrase and "unhide" them if they match the guessed letter. 

building the game:
 1. Something needs to happen when the player clicks "Start Game"
